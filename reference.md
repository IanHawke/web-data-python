## [Getting Data](01-getdata.html)

*   Many sites make data available for download via URLs that are formatted in specific ways.
*   Use the `requests` library to download data in Python programs.
*   Use the `cStringIO` library to treat text as input or output files.
*   Use the `csv` library to read comma-separated values.
*   Write tests.

## [Publishing Data](02-makedata.html)

*   Publish data by putting files with predictable names in a publicly-accessible location.
*   Create a machine-readable index to explicitly tell people what data sets are available.
